THIS FOLDER CONTAINS MY SOLUTION TO ALX TASKS
ON PYTHON TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED INCLUDE:

	add_integer(a, b=98)
	matrix_divided(matrix, div)
	say_my_name(first_name, last_name)
	print_square(size)
	text_identation(text)
	max_integer(list=[])
	matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)
	lazy_matrix_mul(m_a, m_b)

THE TESTS, ALL BUT ONE, WERE IMPLEMENTED INTERACTIVELY USING PYTHON'S DOCTEST
THE unittest MODULE WAS USED FOR ONE OF THE CASES
